## My process

### Built with
- HTML, CSS 

### What I learned

Recap over some of the major learnings while working through this project:
- Basic review of HTML & CSS
- CSS Flex Layout (I've been a little bit better in using it)

<br>

This code snippets/function, if what I'm proud to accomplished:

```css
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
  align-items: center;
  justify-content: center;
```

### Continued development
<hr>

#### Here are a few possible areas that could be added or improved in the HTML and CSS code you provided:
1. **Accessibility:** - It could be more accessible to users with disabilities by:
    - Include appropriate ARIA attributes, alt text, and semantic HTML tags. 
    - Also, providing a larger font size, better color contrast, and using aria-label, aria-roles attributes for the interactive elements.
2. **Responsiveness:** - Using responsive design techniques and media queries for different screen sizes and devices.
